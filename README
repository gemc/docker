Tests:
------

Source: https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/automated-testing/

1. create docker-compose.test.yml, see for example in clas12
2. Whatever test command you specify runs inside a container instantiated from the image
   you are building with Docker Hub. You must ensure that all resources, external applications,
	programs, and scripts are available within your container for your test command to find and use them.
3. test limits:
   - Total execution time: 2 hours
   - Total memory used: 2 GB
   - CPU allocation: 1 CPU
   - Total disk space used: 30 GB

Success/Failure:

Success: exit/return code of zero (0).
Any other code is perceived as an error and will render your build as failed,
not tagging it and not making it available for download on Docker Hub.
