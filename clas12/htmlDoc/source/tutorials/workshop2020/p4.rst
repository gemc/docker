==================================
CLAS12 Workshop April 2020 - *4/6*
==================================


Create a new target using the GEMC api
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's download the clas12 detector sources.


.. code-block:: ruby

 git clone http://github.com/gemc/detectors

This will download all the source code of various experiments. For clas12, some detectors use the native GEMC PERL
API interface, some uses the coatjava geometry service. The latter is not supported in the container at the moment.
Let's use the native API to produce the target geometry:

.. code-block:: ruby

 cd detectors/clas12/targets/
 ./targets.pl config.dat



This will create various target variations. The main player here is the file geometry.pl.
I know, perl is old. Sorry about that. GEMC does have a python API as well that will be documented shortly.

As an exercise, we'll change the cell amterial from LH2 to vacuum. Edit the file geometry.pl on lines 603:


.. code-block:: ruby


 nano -c geometry.pl

 602		$detector{"dimensions"}  = $dimen;
 603		$detector{"material"}    = "G4_lH2";
 604		if($thisVariation eq "lD2") {
 605			$detector{"material"}    = "LD2";
 606		}

Change "G4_lH2" to "G4_Galactic".

Now re-run the perl script to define the new geometry and run gemc:

.. code-block:: ruby

 ./targets.pl config.dat
 gemc target.gcard


Use the camera button and slice X to show a nice cutview of the target.
Use the detector tree button to double check that the material is indeed G4_Galactic.
