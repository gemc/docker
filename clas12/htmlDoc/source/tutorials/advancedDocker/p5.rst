=======================
Advanced Docker - *5/5*
=======================


As the final step in this tutorial, let's use the docker libraries to compile a custom version of gemc.

Create a mygemc directory inside mywork and clone the gemc source code repository:

.. code-block:: ruby


 cd /jlab/work/mywork
 git clone https://github.com/gemc/source.git mygemc
 cd mygemc


|br|

Let's modify gemc.cc so the version used will be "99.99". You can compile gemc by typing:

.. code-block:: ruby

 scons -j4 OPT=1


The -j4 means that you will use 4 cores to speed up the compilation. If you have more cores you should increase this number.

To verify that your changes have been implememted run the "./gemc" executable, you should see your version in the screen log.

.. code-block:: ruby

 ./gemc -USE_GUI=0
