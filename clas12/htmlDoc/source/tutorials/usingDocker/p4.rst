================================
CLAS12 Docker Tutorial  - *4/10*
================================

Inside $CLAS12_BIN (which is in your path) we have three executables. Type::

 ls $CLAS12_BIN/

to list them.

- clasdis: `a SIDIS generatoron based on PEPSI LUND MC <https://github.com/JeffersonLab/clasdis-nocernlib/blob/master/README.md>`_.
- dvcsgen: `dvcs/pi0/eta generator using pdfs and gpds <https://github.com/JeffersonLab/dvcsgen/blob/master/README.md>`_.
- generate-dis: `inclusive DIS generator with radiative corrections <https://github.com/JeffersonLab/inclusive-dis-rad/blob/master/README.md>`_.


|br|


Run the CLASDIS generator
-------------------------

Let's create a "clasdis" directory inside mywork and run clasdis to get 1000 events:

.. code-block:: ruby

 cd /jlab/work/mywork
 mkdir -p clasdis
 cd clasdis
 clasdis --trig 1000 --docker --t 25 35
 ls -lrt

You should see the newly LUND file: **sidis.dat**



The LUND format is described `here <https://gemc.jlab.org/gemc/html/documentation/generator/lund.html>`_.

|br|

Notice each event contains many particles but only **type 1** particles will be generated and tracked by geant4. **type** is the third column in the particle information.

|br|





Run GEMC on sidis.dat
---------------------


Before running gemc, let's take a look at the gcard::

 cat /jlab/work/clas12.gcard

It contains the first experiment detectors, options for magnetic fields, etc.

|br|

Let's run gemc on 200 of those generated events inside sidis.dat:

.. code-block:: ruby

 gemc -USE_GUI=0 -N=200 -INPUT_GEN_FILE="lund, sidis.dat"  /jlab/work/clas12.gcard

The above command take up to a minute to load the magnetic field and setup the necessary physics processes.
You will see many warning messages while creating the tessellated geometry (due to non perfect cad import from engineering model).

After the physics tables are setup each event will take between 500 to 1000 ms, depending on the speed of your computer.

While gemc is running you will notice a lot of these warnings:

.. code-block:: text

 *** G4Exception : GeomNav1002
		issued by : G4Navigator::ComputeStep()
 Track stuck or not moving.
          Track stuck, not moving for 10 steps
          in volume -fc- at point (-68.61918500868757,-2456.519110449012,5124.921251660378)
          direction: (0.2126864369939486,-0.8061501170556744,0.5521652545116739)
          Potential geometry or navigation problem !
          Trying pushing it of 1e-07 mm ...Potential overlap in geometry!

While these are very annoying, they are harmless. There is still some small geometry overlap for some small passive volumes,
and the tessellation of cad import is not perfect. We'll fix these warnings with time... or we'll silence them.

Upon exit gemc will inform you on the the processing time. For example::

 > Total gemc time: 203.73 seconds.  Events only time: 138.181 seconds.

The file out.ev is now ready to be analyzed. If you're curious, you can use evio2xml to peek inside::

 [root@9a5bf4e761b4 clasdis]# evio2xml out.ev | more
 <?xml version="1.0"?>
 <evio-data>
 <!-- ===================== Buffer 1 contains 1637 words (6548 bytes) ===================== -->
