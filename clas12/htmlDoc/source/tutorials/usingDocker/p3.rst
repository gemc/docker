================================
CLAS12 Docker Tutorial  - *3/10*
================================


Use a working directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The docker image will always start with the "pristine" image. In other words every work the the container filesystem will be lost when you exit from a docker container.

Let's create a working directory on your computer so that any work can be saved for later use.
In this tutorial we'll use a "mywork" directory inside your home dir. On your computer type:

.. code-block:: ruby

 mkdir -p ~/mywork

Let's launch docker and mount this directory inside the jlab work dir. We do this by the **-v** option:

.. code-block:: ruby

 docker run -it --rm  -v ~/mywork:/jlab/work/mywork jeffersonlab/clas12software:production bash

Now /jlab/work/mywork will point to your mywork homedir. Inside docker, try this:

.. code-block:: ruby

 echo Hello World > /jlab/work/mywork/hello.txt
 exit

Check it out on your local computer:

.. code-block:: ruby

 cat ~/mywork/hello.txt

Congratulations: you are now able to access a local directory inside docker.

Throughout this tutorial we'll use ~/mywork to store data files.
