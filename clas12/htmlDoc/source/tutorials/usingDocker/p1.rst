================================
CLAS12 Docker Tutorial  - *1/10*
================================

In this tutorial you will learn how to use docker to run GEMC simulations and Coatjava reconstruction.

Installing Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Mac users can download it `here <https://www.docker.com/get-started>`_. Once installed, run the docker app. You should also have `XQuartz <https://www.xquartz.org>`_ installed.
- Linux users can install it using yum. Detailed instructions for Ubuntu can be found `at this page <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/docker/installing_docker_on_linux.htm>`_.



|br|

Running docker for the first time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Use the following command to run docker for the first time:

.. code-block:: ruby

 docker run -it --rm jeffersonlab/clas12software:production bash

|br|

The very first time this will download the *clas12simulations* image. Since it's about 4GB it may take a few minutes.
You will see a log similar to this:

.. code-block:: text

 Unable to find image 'jeffersonlab/clas12software:production' locally

The image contains the necessary software to run simulation and reconstruction.

- gemc with the clas12 geometry
- CLARA
- Coatjava
- The CLAS12 magnetic fields

|br|

Once the download is complete, it will run the container. It will look like a normal shell:

.. code-block:: text

 > Common Environment Version: <2.3>  (Wed October 3 2018)
 > Running as root on a5580672b83f
 > OS Release:    Linux_CentOS7.5.1804-x86_64-gcc4.8.5
 > JLAB_ROOT set to:     /jlab
 > JLAB_SOFTWARE set to: /jlab/2.3/Linux_CentOS7.5.1804-x86_64-gcc4.8.5

 > CCDB 	 version:  1.06.02
 > CLHEP 	 version:  2.4.0.4
 > GEANT4 	 version:  4.10.04.p02
 > QT   	 using system installation
 > XERCESC 	 version:  3.2.2
 > GEMC 	 custom location:  /jlab/clas12Tags/4a.2.5/source
 > EVIO 	 version:  5.1
 > MLIBRARY 	 version:  1.3
 > SCONS 	 version:  1.7


You can type `exit` to quit this docker image.

The second time you're running docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the download is completed, docker will run very fast. In fact it
will feel like you're just opening a new terminal. Running software inside the image
is also not singificantly slower than running natively on the operating system.

You should occasionally make sure your image is up-to-date:

.. code-block:: ruby

 docker pull jeffersonlab/clas12software:production



|br|

Congratulations, you are ready to rock and roll in the CLAS12 software glory.
